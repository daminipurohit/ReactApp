# ReactApp
This is a simple react project with basic set up for webpack!
That just about covers everything you need to be able to render a basic React app, without having to touch create-react-app


## Getting Started

Clone this repo and install dependencies with `npm install`.

### Starting The Dev Server

To start the server, run

```BASH
npm start
```

This starter uses webpack-dev-server to spin up an Express server with Hot-Reloading capability. Changes to code in `.src` should cause pages to reload.

Happy coding!
